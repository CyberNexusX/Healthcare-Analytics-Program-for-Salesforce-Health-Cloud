Healthcare Analytics for Salesforce Health Cloud
A comprehensive analytics solution that integrates with Salesforce Health Cloud to identify high-risk patients who may need intervention based on behavioral and clinical data analysis.
Overview
This solution analyzes patient data from Salesforce Health Cloud to:

Identify high-risk patients using machine learning
Track patient behavior patterns and engagement
Generate personalized intervention recommendations
Create care gaps for care coordination
Provide risk stratification for population health management

Features

Salesforce Health Cloud Integration: Seamless data exchange with Health Cloud
Risk Prediction Model: Machine learning model to predict patient risk levels
Behavioral Analytics: Analysis of medication adherence, appointment attendance, and engagement
Intervention Recommendations: Automated personalized care recommendations
Care Gap Creation: Automated creation of care gaps for high-risk patients
Data Visualization: Risk distribution and patient segmentation reports

Installation

Clone this repository

bashCopygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-analytics.git
cd healthcare-analytics

Create a virtual environment and activate it

bashCopypython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required packages

bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt

Configure your Salesforce credentials

bashCopycp config.example.ini config.ini
# Edit config.ini with your Salesforce credentials
Usage
Basic Usage
pythonCopyfrom healthcare_analytics import HealthcareAnalytics

# Initialize with Salesforce credentials
analytics = HealthcareAnalytics(
    sf_username="your_username@example.com",
    sf_password="your_password",
    sf_security_token="your_security_token"
)

# Run the full analysis pipeline
results = analytics.run_full_analysis()

# Save results to CSV
results.to_csv("patient_risk_analysis.csv", index=False)
Custom Analysis
pythonCopy# Fetch patient data
patient_data = analytics.fetch_patient_data(query_limit=500)

# Preprocess the data
processed_data = analytics.preprocess_data(patient_data)

# Create a new risk model or load existing
analytics.create_risk_model(processed_data)
# or
analytics.load_model('path/to/model.pkl')

# Predict risk scores
risk_results = analytics.predict_risk(processed_data)

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = analytics.generate_intervention_recommendations(risk_results)

# Upload to Salesforce
analytics.upload_risk_scores_to_salesforce(recommendations)
Configuration
The program requires the following Salesforce Health Cloud setup:

Custom fields on the Patient object:

Risk_Score__c (Number)
Risk_Category__c (Picklist: Low, Medium, High)
Last_Risk_Assessment_Date__c (DateTime)


Access to standard Health Cloud objects:

HealthCloudGA__EhrPatient__c
HealthCloudGA__EhrCondition__c
HealthCloudGA__EhrMedication__c
HealthCloudGA__EhrEncounter__c
HealthCloudGA__CareGap__c



Customization
Modifying Risk Factors
Edit the preprocess_data method in healthcare_analytics.py to add or modify risk factors:
pythonCopy# Add your custom risk factor
df['CustomRiskFactor'] = df['Factor1'] * df['Factor2']
Changing Recommendation Logic
Edit the get_recommendation function in the generate_intervention_recommendations method to customize intervention recommendations.
Deployment
For production deployment:

Schedule the analysis to run periodically:
Copy# Example crontab entry to run daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/run_analysis.py

Set up logging to a secure location:
pythonCopy# In your deployment script
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='/var/log/healthcare_analytics.log',
    level=logging.INFO
)

Configure secure credential management using environment variables or a vault service.
